CONFIGURATION FILE
==================

A PressObjects application (POA) can have a configuration file that provides
the application with information and settings for its services at run time.
The configuration file can contain settings for the published properties of
services. As an example, for persistence brokers, it can provide settings
such as database path, user name and password.

File Name
---------
The default configuration file name is derived from the POA's name by changing
its file extension to the value of the SPressConfigFileExt constant.

To use a different configuration file name set it as the value for the
PressApp.ConfigFileName property in the initialization section of any unit.

File Location
-------------
A POA checks for the existence of a configuration file in the same folder as
its executable file.

File Read Timing
----------------
A configuration file is loaded during the POA's initialization, just before
the application starts running but after the initialization section of all
units.

Initialization of Service Settings
----------------------------------
The service property settings are updated to the values in the configuration
file when a service instance is required for the first time.

File Format
-----------
The format of the configuration file is similar to an 'INI' file. It is
divided into sections, each started with a header enclosed in square
brackets. A header consists of a service type name and optionally a service
sub-type name separated by a period(.).  Each section can contain items,
each of which correspond to a published property of the related service.
Comments can be included by preceding them with '#' or '//'. Any entries
after these on a line are ignored.

An example for the Phonebook.exe demo application follows:

<<in file 'Phonebook.cf'>>
[OPFBroker]
// Tell the OPFBroker service to use the IBX broker
DefaultServiceName := 'IBX';
#DefaultServiceName := 'SQLdb';

[OPFBroker.SQLdb]
// These settings are not used
Connector.Database.ConnectorType := '';
Connector.Database.DatabaseName := '';
Connector.Database.UserName := '';
Connector.Database.Password := '';

[OPFBroker.IBX]
// Include the required settings for the IBX broker
Connector.Database.DatabaseName := 'G:\Database\IBX\PO\Phonebook.gdb';
Connector.UserName := 'sysdba';
Connector.Password := 'masterkey';
