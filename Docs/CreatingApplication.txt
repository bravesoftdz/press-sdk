CREATING AN APPLICATION
=======================

This document contains a summary of the steps necessary to create an 
application with PressObjects. Several of the following steps will be improved 
or removed when the Project Explorer, which is under development, becomes 
available.
 
1. Create a new project;

2. If required, create the Presenter of the main form (see 'MVP.txt');

3. Modify the main project file, by substituting the call to 'Application.Run'
with:

'<MainPresenterClass>.Run' - if the application has a main Presenter class, 
or
'PressApp.Run' - if the application doesn't have a main Presenter class.
  
4. Include the persistence service in the project (see 'Persistence.txt');

5. Create a business class model (see 'BusinessClasses.txt'). Note that the 
current InstantObjects' broker implementation requires two synchronized 
business models, the PressObjects model (used by several PressObjects 
frameworks) and the InstantObjects model (used to create and synchronize the 
database, and to retrieve and store persistent objects);

6. Create forms for the business classes;

7. Create a Presenter for each form (see 'MVP.txt');

8. Create Commands and connect them as desired - with the Model through its 
context menu, and/or with visual components and/or menu items (see 'MVP.txt').
