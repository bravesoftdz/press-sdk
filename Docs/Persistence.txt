PERSISTENCE
===========

PressObjects, currently, does not possess a persistence framework, therefore
this task is executed through a persistence broker.

To select a broker, include its unit in the uses clause of any project file.

InstantObjects
--------------

To use InstantObjects (IO), a minimum of two units must be added to the uses
clause of any project file. One must be 'PressInstantObjectsBroker' plus
at least one of the IO broker units (eg 'InstantIBX') for database access.

IO Notes:
1. Navigational brokers (like InstantBDE) aren't supported.
2. If IO version 2.1 (or IO from SourceForge repository SVN revision 702 or 
   higher) then ensure that the compiler conditional symbol 'IO2.1' is defined
   in the PressInstantObjectsBroker.pas unit.
