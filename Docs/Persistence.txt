PERSISTENCE
===========

PressObjects, currently, does not possess a persistence framework, therefore
this task is executed through a persistence broker.

To select a broker, include its unit in the uses clause of any project file.

InstantObjects
--------------

To use InstantObjects (IO), a minimum of two units must be added to the uses
clause of any project file. One must be 'PressInstantObjectsBroker' plus
at least one of the IO broker units (eg 'InstantBDE') for database access.
